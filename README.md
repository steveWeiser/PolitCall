# PoliticalActionKit
Large project for Fall 2018 COP4331

Be sure to NOT push to master branch. We will edit and update all code on sub-branches, like "development".
After new updates on development branches are tested, we will then push/merge to master.


You may need to download "npm" online before working on anything.

"create-react-native-app" == CRNA (just to save time in notes)

Clone this repository, and if needed run "create-react-native-app", or "npm start".
I'm not sure if cloning the repo is enough. You might still need to make it a react native project on you computer.
    if CRNA doesn't work, run "npm i -g create-react-native-app" then CRNA on directory.

to run app on adroid emulator, download android studio, and download a phone emulator on it. 
Run the emulator (tools) on android stuio, then on command line type "npm run android" when on 
project directory and it will boot app up on android emulator automatically.
You can just edit code, then save, and it will automatically update the app.
